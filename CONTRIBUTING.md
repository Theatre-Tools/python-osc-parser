## Contributing
Contributors to this project are more than welcome, weather you have just started or are experienced in open source contributions,
I am happy for you to contribute to this project. However, I do have some requirements.

- Be nice please, I want this to be a project that doesn't have a dark doomy cloud of "but the maintainers are hard to work with".
- Please make your code clean, easy to understand, and make every solution the best solution **YOU** can come up with. I don't care that it's the best, I care that you tried.
- Please explain your changes, when you make them, and why. I'm not a programmer by trade, nor am I particularly good at it, please please explain in your PRs what you have done, and why.
- My AI policy is simple, don't make it effect the project, or the maintainers of this project. If your changes make it hard to maintain this project going into the future, or otherwise compromises the integrity of this project, please think about what you are committing.
- Please test your changes, and please follow the MR template.
